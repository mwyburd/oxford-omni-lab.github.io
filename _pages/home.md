# Welcome to OMNI Lab at University of Oxford

By developing computational tools, the OMNI Lab aims to address key needs in modern medicine: (i) automated analysis relieves the requirement for highly-skilled radiologists; (ii) discovery of novel markers for diagnostic screening; (iii) software for portable devices, thus broadening access to high-quality care in the developing world; and (iv) investing in sophisticated software while leveraging existing imaging hardware provides a large cost benefit to an already constrained healthcare system.

Over the past few years, there has been rapid progress in our understanding of the developing brain. 
By leveraging the strengths of deep learning, we aim to continue this progress using ultrasound imaging: the first step in the continuum of pregnancy care, and the modality that is ubiquitous in medical centres around the world.

There are four main areas of research:

1. **Brain development**: Genomic analysis of DNA using high-throughput sequencing to identify genes associated with human disorders
2. **Understanding the noncoding genome**: Using whole-genome sequencing to identify the elements of the noncoding genome that contribute to ASD
3. **The role of SCN2A in human disorders**: SCN2A mutations are one of the most common causes of ASD; we aim to understand how this risk is mediated with the view to developing therapeutics
4. **Understanding neurodevelopment**: Leveraging functional genomic data to understand physiological brain development and the pathology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders
5. **Sex bias in ASD**: Identifying genes and gene networks that lead to the preponderance of males diagnosed with ASD

### Technologies and methods
The OMNI Lab is primarily a computational group that uses a wide range of machine learning and image analysis methods to process large-scale population datasets of brain images. A list of tools and resources can be found in our [resources](resources) page.

### Joining the OMNI Lab
If you are interested in joining please go to the [recruitment](recruitment) page.

### Funding
We are grateful for funding from the University of Oxford [EPSRC Impact Acceleration scheme, and EPSRC Doctoral Prizes](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/), [Bill and Medlinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/), the Academy of Medical Sciences [Springboard Awards scheme](https://acmedsci.ac.uk/), and the [Royal Academy of Engineering](https://raeng.org.uk/).
